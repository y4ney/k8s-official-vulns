In Kubernetes clusters using Ceph RBD as a storage provisioner, with logging level of at least 4,  Ceph RBD admin secrets can be written to logs. This occurs in kube-controller-manager's logs during provisioning of Ceph RBD persistent claims.

### Am I vulnerable?
If Ceph RBD volumes are in use and kube-controller-manager is using a log level of at least 4.

#### Affected Versions
kubernetes v1.19.0 - v1.19.2
kubernetes v1.18.0 - v1.18.9
