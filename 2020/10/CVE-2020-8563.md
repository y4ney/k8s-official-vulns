In Kubernetes clusters using VSphere as a cloud provider, with a logging level set to 4 or above, VSphere cloud credentials will be leaked in the cloud controller manager's log.

### Am I vulnerable?
If you are using VSphere as a cloud provider, have verbose logging enabled, and an attacker can access cluster logs, then you may be vulnerable to this.

#### Affected Versions
kube-controller-manager v1.19.0 - v1.19.2

#### How do I mitigate this vulnerability?
Do not enable verbose logging in production, limit access to cluster logs.

#### Fixed Versions
v1.19.3

To upgrade, refer to the documentation: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/cluster-management/#upgrading-a-cluster
