**Is this a BUG REPORT or FEATURE REQUEST?**: Bug

/kind bug

**What happened**:
kubectl cp <pod-name>:/some/remote/dir /some/local/dir

If the container returns a malformed tarfile with paths like:

'/some/remote/dir/../../../../tmp/foo' kubectl writes this to `/tmp/foo` instead of `/some/local/dir/tmp/foo`

**What you expected to happen**:

I expect kubectl to clean up the path and write to `/some/local/dir/tmp/foo`
