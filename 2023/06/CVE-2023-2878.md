A security issue was discovered in [secrets-store-csi-driver](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/secrets-store-csi-driver) where an actor with access to the driver logs could observe service account tokens. These tokens could then potentially be exchanged with external cloud providers to access secrets stored in cloud vault solutions. Tokens are only logged when [TokenRequests is configured in the CSIDriver object](https://kubernetes-csi.github.io/docs/token-requests.html) and the driver is set to run at log level 2 or greater via the -v flag.

This issue has been rated **MEDIUM** [CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N) (6.5), and assigned **CVE-2023-2878**

**Am I vulnerable?**

You may be vulnerable if [TokenRequests is configured in the CSIDriver object](https://kubernetes-csi.github.io/docs/token-requests.html) and the driver is set to run at log level 2 or greater via the -v flag.

To check if token requests are configured, run the following command:

```shell
kubectl get csidriver secrets-store.csi.k8s.io -o jsonpath="{.spec.tokenRequests}"
```

To check if tokens are being logged, examine the secrets-store container log:

```shell
kubectl logs -l app=secrets-store-csi-driver -c secrets-store -f | grep --line-buffered "csi.storage.k8s.io/serviceAccount.tokens"
```

**Affected Versions**

- secrets-store-csi-driver < 1.3.3

**How do I mitigate this vulnerability?**

Prior to upgrading, this vulnerability can be mitigated by running secrets-store-csi-driver at log level 0 or 1 via the -v flag.

**Fixed Versions**

- secrets-store-csi-driver >= 1.3.3

To upgrade, refer to the documentation: [https://secrets-store-csi-driver.sigs.k8s.io/getting-started/upgrades.html#upgrades](https://secrets-store-csi-driver.sigs.k8s.io/getting-started/upgrades.html#upgrades)

**Detection**

Examine cloud provider logs for unexpected token exchanges, as well as unexpected access to cloud vault secrets.
