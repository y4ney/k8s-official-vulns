A security issue was discovered in Kubernetes where a user that can create pods and persistent volumes on Windows nodes may be able to escalate to admin privileges on those nodes. Kubernetes clusters are only affected if they are using an in-tree storage plugin for Windows nodes.

### Am I vulnerable?

Any kubernetes environment with Windows nodes is impacted.  Run `kubectl get nodes -l kubernetes.io/os=windows` to see if any Windows nodes are in use.

#### Affected Versions

- kubelet >= v1.8.0 (including all later minor versions)

### How do I mitigate this vulnerability?

The provided patch fully mitigates the vulnerability.

Outside of applying the provided patch, there are no known mitigations to this vulnerability.

#### Fixed Versions

- kubelet master - fixed by #121881
- kubelet v1.28.4 - fixed by #121882
- kubelet v1.27.8 - fixed by #121883
- kubelet v1.26.11 - fixed by #121884
- kubelet v1.25.16 - fixed by #121885

To upgrade, refer to the documentation:
