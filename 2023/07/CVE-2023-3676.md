- kubelet <= v1.28.0
- kubelet <= v1.27.4
- kubelet <= v1.26.7
- kubelet <= v1.25.12

### Detection

Kubernetes audit logs can be used to detect if this vulnerability is being exploited. Pod create events with embedded powershell commands are a strong indication of exploitation. Config maps and secrets that contain embedded powershell commands and are mounted into pods are also a strong indication of exploitation.

If you find evidence that this vulnerability has been exploited, please contact security@kubernetes.io
