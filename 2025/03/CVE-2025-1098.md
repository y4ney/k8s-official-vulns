CVSS Rating: [CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) (Score: 8.8, High)

A security issue was discovered in [ingress-nginx](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx) where the \`mirror-target\` and \`mirror-host\` Ingress annotations can be used to inject arbitrary configuration into nginx. This can lead to arbitrary code execution in the context of the ingress-nginx controller, and disclosure of Secrets accessible to the controller. (Note that in the default installation, the controller can access all Secrets cluster-wide.)

### Am I vulnerable?

This issue affects ingress-nginx. If you do not have ingress-nginx installed on your cluster, you are not affected. You can check this by running \`kubectl get pods \--all-namespaces \--selector app.kubernetes.io/name=ingress-nginx\`.

#### Affected Versions

- < v1.11.0
- v1.11.0 \- 1.11.4  
- v1.12.0

### How do I mitigate this vulnerability?

**ACTION REQUIRED:** The following steps must be taken to mitigate this vulnerability: Upgrade ingress-nginx to v1.11.5, v1.12.1, or any later version.

#### Fixed Versions
