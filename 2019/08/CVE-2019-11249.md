A third issue was discovered with the Kubernetes `kubectl cp` command that could enable a directory traversal such that a malicious container could replace or create files on a userâ€™s workstation. The vulnerability is a client-side defect and requires user interaction to be exploited.
 
**Vulnerable versions:**
Kubernetes 1.0.x-1.12.x
Kubernetes 1.13.0-1.13.8
Kubernetes 1.14.0-1.14.4
Kubernetes 1.15.0-1.15.1
 
**Vulnerable configurations:**
All `kubectl` clients running a vulnerable version and using the `cp` operation.
 
**Vulnerability impact:**
A malicious user can potentially create or overwrite files outside of the destination directory of the `kubectl cp` operation.
 
**Mitigations prior to upgrading:**
Avoid using `kubectl cp` with any untrusted workloads.
 
**Fixed versions:**
Fixed in v1.13.9 by #80871
Fixed in v1.14.5 by #80870
Fixed in v1.15.2 by #80869
Fixed in master by #80436
 
**Fix impact:**
The `kubectl cp` function is prevented from creating or modifying files outside the destination directory.
